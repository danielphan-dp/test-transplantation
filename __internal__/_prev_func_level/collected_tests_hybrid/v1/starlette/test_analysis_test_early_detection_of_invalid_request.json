To trigger processing, you have to call :meth:`next_event`.\n\n        Args:\n            data (:term:`bytes-like object`):\n                The new data that was just received.\n\n                Special case: If *data* is an empty byte-string like ``b\"\"``,\n                then this indicates that the remote side has closed the\n                connection (end of file). Normally this is convenient, because\n                standard Python APIs like :meth:`file.read` or\n                :meth:`socket.recv` use ``b\"\"`` to indicate end-of-file, while\n                other failures to read are indicated using other mechanisms\n                like raising :exc:`TimeoutError`.
