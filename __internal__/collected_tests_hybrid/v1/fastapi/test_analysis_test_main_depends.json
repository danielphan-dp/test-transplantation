If you returned an object\n                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does\n                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have\n                    that `password`.\n                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the\n                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the\n                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not\n                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,\n                    so it's an error from the API developer.
