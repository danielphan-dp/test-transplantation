Tweens behave a bit like\n        :term:`WSGI` 'middleware' but they have the benefit of running in a\n        context in which they have access to the Pyramid :term:`application\n        registry` as well as the Pyramid rendering machinery.\n\n        .. note:: You can view the tween ordering configured into a given\n                  Pyramid application by using the ``ptweens``\n                  command.
