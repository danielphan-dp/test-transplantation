### Candidates for Test Transplantation
The high-level strategy is to find candidate pairs for each category and then select the best one for each category. It can be as simple as a feature that input and produces the same output, or a set of features that together produce the same output (their can be different implementations, e.g. parallelized, distributed, etc., but the output must be the same or comparable).

- API Development: Flask and FastAPI, Django and Flask

- Request Handling: HTTPX and Requests

- CLI Development: Click and Typer

- Data Structures and Algorithms Libraries:
  - Graph Processing: NetworkX and graph-tool
  - Scientific Computing: NumPy and SciPy
  - Symbolic Mathematics: SymPy and Sage
  - Machine Learning: scikit-learn and mlpack
  - Optimization: PuLP and CVXPY
  - Numerical Algorithms: SciPy and Numba
  - Big Data Processing: Dask and PySpark
  - Time Series Analysis: pandas and statsmodels
  - Probabilistic Programming: PyMC and Edward

- Regex Libraries: re and regex

- Hashing: hashlib and bcrypt

- Data Serialization: json (standard library) and ujson

(Note: For each pair, different implementations may exist, e.g., parallelized, distributed, etc., but the output should be the same or comparable)

- Libraries Supporting Different Computing Infrastructures: CuPy and Numpy

- Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow and PyTorch

- Data Validation: Pydantic and Marshmallow, Pydantic and Cerberus

- JSON Schema Validation: jsonschema and fastjsonschema

### Experimentation
1. Create a folder.
2. Clone Repo A.
3. Clone Repo B.
4. Look for the candidate test pairs (through code search, LLMs, and manual inspection).
