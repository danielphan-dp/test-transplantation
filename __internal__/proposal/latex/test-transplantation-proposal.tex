\section{Introduction}
Automating software transplantation has long been a challenging problem in software engineering research, especially when applied to real-world codebases. Software transplantation, when can be done, can be highly useful for developers. Software transplantation aims to extract a feature from one system, referred to as the `donor program,` and integrate it into another system, the `host program,` which lacks that feature. This process can significantly reduce the time needed to develop new features, particularly when writing unit tests. In this project, we focus on building a tool for unit test transplantationâ€”transplanting unit tests from one project repository to another that tests the same functionality. By utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and large language models (LLMs), we aim to develop a system that can potentially save software developers significant time by automating the reuse of unit tests across projects with similar functionality.
